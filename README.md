# Password-Challenge

## Description
This project was built to get more familiar with JavaScript. This included linking to HTML and CSS, functions, variables, etc. in order to modify starter code for  a password  generator page. This was a pretty challenging project and one that could have honeslty been developed much more. Alot of commits and changes did not  show up on the browser page/ were not successful in making the page functional. This can be fixed by looking over it in more detail in order to analyze what went wrong and much more practice with calling functions/ event listeners/ queries, and more. The basics are understood but the execution and how they work together are what went wrong. 

## Installation
The first thing to get the project up and running is to make a new folder and clone the repository with the starter code to the local machine. From there, it is important to create  files for css, JavaScript, and HTML. The next step is to link  these things. Next, modifying the starter code and adding  more to the code can  happen. After making changes, these changes can be saved and then eventually commited and pushed (make sure to add a  description for each new commit). Then, Using GitPages, deploy the webpage.

## Usage
To use this, go to the HTTPS page and the  password generator should be there. This challenge usage is more to take a lesson of learning from some very obvious mistakes. To be able to use this, the former instructions in the above installation section (i.e. deploy to GitPages, etc.) are also applicable.
